/**
 *  Takes an RLP item, returns its length and stores the pointer to the value and to the next item in the given parameters.
 *  The barrier parameter is the address immediately after the transaction buffer. If parsing produces any address (value or next)
 *  which is larger than the barrier, parsing will fail. This is a protection against malformed data.
 *
 *  On failure this function returns -1 and. Value and next pointer will point to NULL. If the address of next is exactly the barrier, then
 *  the function will not fail but the next pointer will point to NULL, indicating that this was the last field.
